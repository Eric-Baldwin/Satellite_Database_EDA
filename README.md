----- Dataset Shape

7560 x 67


----- Describe the available fields.

There are 18 catagorical fields:

Current Official Name of Satellite
Country/Org of UN Registry
Country of Operator/Owner
Operator/Owner
Users
Purpose
Detailed Purpose
Class of Orbit
Type of Orbit
Dry Mass (kg.)
Power (watts)
Date of Launch
Contractor

Launch Site
Launch Vehicle
COSPAR Number
Comments


There are 9 quantitative fields:

Longitude of GEO (degrees)
Perigee (km)
Apogee (km)
Eccentricity
Inclination (degrees)
Period (minutes)
Launch Mass (kg.)
Expected Lifetime (yrs.)
NORAD Number

There are 40 unnamed fields with only a small amount of unknown data in them. Those will be removed. There are also some fields with "NR" in them which stand for "Not Recorded" Im assuming.

The data is raw and unprocessed.


----- Potential avenues of inquiry

This dataset could show how often different countries launch a satellite and what kinds of satellites they are launinching and into which orbit.


----- Value proposition

This could be usefull info for private companies or governments who are trying to put things in orbit or who are trying to figure out if there is a gap or need for specific types of satellites.
